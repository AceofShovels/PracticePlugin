# Installation
*This plugin requires IPA which you will automatically get if you install [the Song Loader Plugin](https://github.com/xyonico/BeatSaberSongLoader/releases).*

1. Make sure that Beat Saber is not running.
2. Extract the `PracticePlugin.dll` into the `Beat Saber/Plugins` folder.  
	For Oculus Home: `.../Oculus Apps/Software/hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber`  
	For Steam: `.../steamapps/common/Beat Saber`
		(The folder that contains Beat Saber.exe)
4. Done! You've installed the Practice Plugin.

# Usage
You will see the speed option in the pause menu. If you turn enable No Fail, you will be able to go below 100% speed.

The seeker is only available in No Fail mode.
Move the blue diamond below the seeker to where you want the loop to start and move the red diamond to where you want the loop to end.
