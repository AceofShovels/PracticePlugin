# Installation
*This plugin requires IPA which you will automatically get if you install [the Song Loader Plugin](https://github.com/xyonico/BeatSaberSongInjector/releases).*

2. Extract the `PracticePlugin.dll` into the `Beat Saber/Plugins` folder.  
	For Oculus Home: `.../Oculus Apps/Software/hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber`  
	For Steam: `.../steamapps/common/Beat Saber`
		(The folder that contains Beat Saber.exe)
4. Done! You've installed the Practice Plugin.

# Usage
You will see the speed option in the pause menu if you play a song with **No Fail** enabled.
